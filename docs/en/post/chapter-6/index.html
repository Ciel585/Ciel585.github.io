Unlike cartoons from other countries, intended mainly for children to watch, most of the anime produced is designed for teenage and adult audiences, and largely due to this it is very popular in the world. Anime is characterized by a characteristic manner of drawing characters and backgrounds. It is published in the form of television series, as well as films distributed on video media or intended for film screening. Plots can describe a variety of characters, differ in a variety of places and eras, genres and styles. The sources for the plot of anime series are most often: manga (Japanese comics), ranobe (light novel) or computer games (usually in the genre of &ldquo;visual novel&rdquo;). During the film adaptation, the graphic style and other features of the original are usually preserved. Other sources are used less often, for example, works of classical literature. There are also anime that have a completely original plot (in this case, the anime itself can serve as a source for creating book and manga versions based on it). The meaning of the term &ldquo;anime&rdquo; may vary depending on the context. In Western countries, anime is the object of research by cultural scientists, sociologists and anthropologists - Eri Izawa, Scott MacLeod, Susan Napier, Sharon Kinsella and others.</p>
