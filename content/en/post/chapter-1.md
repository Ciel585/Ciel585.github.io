Anime, like other video products, is created with a specific distribution method in mind. These methods include showing on television, in cinemas, selling on video media, and distributing via the Internet. The chosen method leaves its mark on the work, since production processes, budgets, and viewing conditions vary significantly. The most popular formats for anime are television series and OVAs, due to the nature of which they can accommodate a much more detailed story and better develop characters than in a film, but this also determines the reluctance of animators to technical experiments and the predominant role of designers when creating anime.

If a work turns out to be successful, then sometimes its sequels or reissues are released in other formats. For example, the famous series "Tenchi Muyo" was first released as an OVA with several episodes. Subsequently, several films appeared, three seasons of a television series of 26 episodes each, as well as several additional stories (English “spinoffs”).

Regardless of the source format, any anime is sooner or later released on video media, usually on DVD.
