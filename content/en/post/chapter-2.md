The division of anime into genres is very blurry. Anime shares:

1) By target audience (children, boys, girls, men, women);
2) By storytelling style (comedy, drama, thriller, romance, etc.);
3) By setting and technology (mecha, cyberpunk, school history, fantasy, steampunk, etc.);
4) According to the psychology, goals and nature of the relationships of the characters (sentai, spokon, maho-shojo, harem);
5) By the presence and detail of sexual scenes (ecchi, hentai, yaoi, yuri).

Typically, the main characters in anime are characters of gender and age that fit the target audience.
