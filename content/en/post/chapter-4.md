Japanese animation differs from the animation of other countries, first of all, in that it is a developing closed cultural layer, which includes many unique plot and ideological symbols, templates, stereotypes and types. The simplest examples would be genres specific to anime, such as fur, which live according to their own laws, or elements of Japanese culture that are often reflected in anime.

Anime stands out among animation from other countries due to its relevance in Japanese society. This also determines the general focus of a certain proportion of works on an older audience, which is expressed in greater attention to the philosophical and ideological components, the predominance of “adult” motives in the subject matter, and, among other things, less taboo topics of sex and violence in the culture as a whole.

Most anime are created with a specific, sometimes quite narrow, target audience in mind. The division criteria can be gender, age, psychological type of the viewer. The metagenre chosen in this way sets the overall direction of the work, influencing its plot, ideas and even the manner of depiction. Children's (kodomo) anime makes up the majority of all animation production produced in Japan, but more “adult” works are popular outside the country.
