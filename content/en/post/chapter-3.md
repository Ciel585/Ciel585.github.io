Anime is usually created by small animation studios, and its production is financed by larger companies. The creation of television series usually takes a short time, so small mistakes are not taken into account by the animators. When creating full-length animation, there is more serious quality control, but production deadlines are looser. Orders for a specific anime are formed by producers. An anime director is usually responsible for the art direction of the cartoon, his responsibilities also include casting voice actors and creating a director's storyboard that graphically describes key moments. Projects usually involve a director-animator who coordinates the work of groups of animators. Anime characters are created by a character designer, who is often also the main animator. The frame rate of Japanese animated series is usually between 8 and 12 frames per second, but more advanced animated films can be shot at 24 frames per second. When working with graphics, studios actively use computer technologies. As soon as the animation sequence is completed, the voice actors begin work.

There are over 430 anime studios in Japan. The largest of them include Bones, Gainax, Gonzo, Madhouse, Studio Pierrot, Toei Animation, etc. In order to increase efficiency in working on complex projects, studios sometimes work together. If an anime lays claim to worldwide fame, then its release is almost always accompanied by the release of various related products: toys, items of clothing with images of heroes, etc. It is the sale of related products that often brings more profit to producers than the rental of anime itself.
